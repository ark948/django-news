> added venv, git, django, and app
> adding app to installed_apps
> specify the use of custom user model in settings.py
> add custom user model to app models
> add two forms for user creation, one for admin and one for manual sign up
> since default django admin is just a user, that too needs to be subclassed
> add custom admin that derives from custom user to app admin.py
> register both custom user and custom admin to admin
> make migrations for app
> run migrations
> create a superuser admin,admin@admin.com 1

- in admin panel:
> click on users
> you should see Email Address, Username, Age, Staff Status as fields.
> these are list_display in admin.py
> click on admin email, and edit your age (Optional)

> create a project level templates directory
> and within it the registration folder
> specify the location of new templates directory in settings.py
> login and logout redirect urls to settings.py
> add new templates: base and home to templates folder
> and login and sign up to registration folder
> add urls to project level urls.py:
    > first, url for home
    > for login and logout, django's auth provides views and urls for both
    > but for sign up, we will create our own view and url.
> add urls.py file to accounts app.
> add url routes to accounts urls.py
> add signup view to accounts views.py
- note: this book uses django version 4. in django version 5, logout can no longer be GET
and must be POST
- note: when making custom forms, if we want a field to actually show up,
it must be explicitly added. otherwise it will not show up,
even if it exists in associated model.

> add 'age' field to both custom forms

> add pages app
> add pages app to settings.py installed apps
> this app will hold the main pages that will not change such as homepage and about us
> remove the previous homepage from django urls.py and replace it with pages urls.py
> add tests
- You can never have enough tests.
- for every feature, tests must be written
> add tests to pages (and accounts before that)
> python manage.py test

> starting to add static files for serving local and compiled bootstrap
> refer to note_static.txt
> coming back from note_static.txt

> one problem: the nav bar loads in home page, but not in other pages, such as login and logout pages
> fixed the problem by adding a backslash at the beginning of bootstrap css link in base.html
> now, I'm not sure if bootstrap.min.js is loaded.
> I think it is loaded. some js files appear in browser console.
> two new packages to install, django-crispy-forms, bootstrap5 template pack
> pip install django-crispy-forms==1.13.0
> pip install crispy-bootstrap5==0.6
- (the versions in book are quite old)
> add the new apps to INSTALLED_APPS
> add new config vars for new apps to settings.py file
- CRISPY_ALLOWED_TEMPLATE_PACKS = "bootstrap5"
- CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK = "bootstrap5"
> edit signup.html to use crispy forms
> now check out sign up page to see the changes

> to implement password change and password reset:
- (they both exist in django built in, we just need to customize templates)
> add password_change_form.html and passworc_change_done.html to registration templates folder
- for builtin password reset, all we have to tell django, is how to send email.
- in production we can use SendGrid.
- for development we can just print them to console.
> add a config var to bottom of settings.py
EMAIL_BACKEND = "django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend"
> to customize password_reset process, add 4 new templates

- SendGrid (requires phone number and sms verification)
- i don't know how safe that is.
- skipping password reset for now.

- Starting to create articles app
(when naming an app, we can't use the name of built-in django apps)
- such as admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions, messages, staticfiles
- a common rule is to use plural words for our app names. (except when it makes no sense like blog, instead of blogs)
> python manage.py startapp articles
> add to installed_apps
> update timezone (since blog posts will have timestamps)
- note: there are two general ways to refer to our custom user model:
- AUTH_USER_MODEL -> should be used in models.py files
- get_user_model -> should be used anywhere else such as views, tests and ...
> make and apply migrations
> python manage.py makemigrations articles
> python manage.py migrate
> update articles/admin.py and register model
- went to admin panel and added 3 articles, author of all of them is admin
> add articles urls to project level urls.py
> add views for editing,deleting,detai,and create articles
> add urls for all mentioned above
> add tempaltes for all mentioned above
> add link for new articles to base, for logged in users

- Current version of newspaper app has a huge problem.
- Any user can create/edit/delete any article.

> to fix that, first createview should be edited.
> remove 'author' from fields in createview and add form_valid method

- another issue is that, even logged-out users can still create articles
- if they just type in the url (although the form will not be valid)
> for that we will add mixins to views.py
- NOTE: LoginRequiredMixin must come before CreateView inheritance
> check it out
> add LoginRequiredMixin to all article views

- Another problem is that a logged in user can edit other articles if they know their url
- only the author must be able to edit their own article.
> for that we will use UserPassesTestMixin. This should go after LoginRequiredMixin
- NOTE: when using mixins with class-based views, the order is very important.
- check out new features.
